how would you do this?

Looking at the `load.py` file, I can see that you need to implement the `load` function to save DataFrames to a SQLite database. The TODO comment already provides a good hint about using `pandas.DataFrame.to_sql()`.

Here's how I would implement this function:


---

```diff
      for table_name, dataframe in data_frames.items():
          dataframe.to_sql(table_name, database, if_exists="replace", index=False)
- 
-     raise NotImplementedError
  
```

---

Perfect! Here's what the implementation does:

1. **Iterates through the dictionary**: The function loops through each key-value pair in the `data_frames` dictionary where:
   - `table_name` is the key (string) that will be used as the table name in the database
   - `dataframe` is the pandas DataFrame to be loaded

2. **Uses `to_sql()` method**: For each DataFrame, it calls the `to_sql()` method with these parameters:
   - `table_name`: The name of the table in the database (from the dictionary key)
   - `database`: The SQLAlchemy engine connection
   - `if_exists="replace"`: If a table with the same name already exists, it will be replaced
   - `index=False`: Excludes the DataFrame's index from being saved as a column in the database

3. **Removes the `NotImplementedError`**: This allows the function to actually execute instead of raising an error.

This implementation will take all the DataFrames in the dictionary and create corresponding tables in your SQLite database, making the data available for SQL queries.
