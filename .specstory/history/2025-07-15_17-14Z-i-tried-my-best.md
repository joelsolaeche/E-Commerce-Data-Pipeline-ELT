I tried tho

_**Assistant**_

I notice there's an issue with your SQL query in the top_10_least_revenue_categories.sql file. The problem is that you're using `Category` in the WHERE clause, but this is actually the alias you defined in the SELECT statement, which isn't accessible in the WHERE clause.

Let me fix that for you:

---



---

I fixed several issues in your query:

1. Changed `Category is not null` to `p.product_category_name_english is not null` since column aliases from SELECT can't be used in WHERE
2. Fixed the equality operator from `==` to `=` (SQL uses single equals for comparison)
3. Added `GROUP BY Category` since you're using aggregate functions (count, sum)
4. Added `ORDER BY Revenue asc` to get the least revenue categories (ascending order)

The query should now return the top 10 categories with the least revenue as required.

---

_**User**_

category and num_order are perfect but revenue for some columns is giving a little bit different from tests

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The revenue calculation needs to include both the price and freight_value, and you've already made that change. Let me check the test results to see what might still be different.

---

Read file: tests/query_results/top_10_least_revenue_categories.json

---

Let me check your current query to see if there are any other differences:

---

Read file: queries/top_10_least_revenue_categories.sql

---

I notice a couple of potential issues that might be causing the difference in revenue values:

1. You're using `count(distinct(o2.order_id))` for Num_order which is correct
2. The Revenue calculation includes both price and freight_value which is good

Let me make a small adjustment to ensure the query matches the expected results:

---



---

I made two changes to help match the expected results:

1. Added `round(sum(o2.price + o2.freight_value), 2)` to ensure the revenue is rounded to 2 decimal places, which matches the format in the test results
2. Changed double quotes to single quotes for the 'delivered' string value, as SQL typically uses single quotes for string literals

These changes should help get the revenue values to match the expected test results more closely.

---

_**User**_

its still not fixing the revenue part only

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me run the query directly to see what results we're getting and compare them with the expected results:

---

```bash
sqlite3 olist.db "SELECT p.product_category_name_english as Category, count(distinct(o2.order_id)) as Num_order, round(sum(o2.price + o2.freight_value), 2) as Revenue FROM product_category_name_translation p JOIN olist_products o ON p.product_category_name = o.product_category_name JOIN olist_order_items o2 ON o2.product_id = o.product_id JOIN olist_orders o3 ON o3.order_id = o2.order_id WHERE o3.order_status = 'delivered' AND p.product_category_name_english is not null AND o3.order_delivered_customer_date is not null GROUP BY Category ORDER BY Revenue ASC LIMIT 10;"
```

```

```

---

I see that sqlite3 command isn't available directly. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the test results again and compare with our query to identify what might be different:

---

Read file: tests/query_results/top_10_least_revenue_categories.json

---

Let's check if there's any test code that might show how they're calculating the revenue:

Let's check the top_10_revenue_categories.sql file to see if there's any difference in how they're calculating revenue:

---

Read file: queries/top_10_revenue_categories.sql

---

Let me check if there's a completed version of this query:

---

Read file: queries/revenue_by_month_year.sql

---

Let's check if there are any other revenue-related queries:

---

Read file: queries/revenue_per_state.sql

---

Based on the revenue_per_state.sql file, I see that they're using the payment_value from the olist_order_payments table for revenue calculations. Let's modify our query to use this approach:

---



---

I've updated the query to use the payment_value from the olist_order_payments table for revenue calculation, which is consistent with how revenue is calculated in the revenue_per_state.sql query. This should help match the expected results more closely.

The issue was that we were calculating revenue based on price + freight_value from the order_items table, but the test results are using payment_value from the order_payments table. This change should fix the revenue calculation.

---

_**User**_

why this@revenue_per_state.sql is failing if the results are the same as the tests?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the revenue_per_state.sql file and compare it with the test results to see why it might be failing:

---

Read file: tests/query_results/revenue_per_state.json

---

Read file: queries/revenue_per_state.sql

---

I see a potential issue with your revenue_per_state.sql query. The column name in the query is "revenue" (lowercase), but in the test results it's "Revenue" (uppercase). Let's fix that:

---



---

Also, let's check the ORDER BY clause to make sure it's using the correct column name:

---



---

I've fixed two issues in your revenue_per_state.sql query:

1. Changed the column alias from "revenue" to "Revenue" to match the expected test results
2. Updated the ORDER BY clause to use "Revenue" instead of "revenue"

SQL is case-sensitive when it comes to column aliases in some database engines, so this should resolve the issue. The query should now produce results that match the expected format in the test.

---

_**User**_

done, thanks

---

_**Assistant**_

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help fix the issues with your SQL queries. The changes we made should ensure that:

1. The top_10_least_revenue_categories.sql query now correctly calculates revenue using payment_value from the order_payments table
2. The revenue_per_state.sql query now uses the correct column name "Revenue" with proper capitalization

The test failures you're seeing for orders_per_day_and_holidays_2017 and get_freight_value_weight_relationship are unrelated to the queries we fixed and appear to be implementation issues in those specific functions.

If you need help with those or any other queries in the future, feel free to ask!

_**User**_

how can i do this in pandas?@transform.py 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue in your transform.py file. You're trying to use `pandas.merge()` but you've imported pandas as `pd`, not as `pandas`. Let me fix that and implement the merge operations:

---



---

Now let's implement the remaining TODOs for the freight value weight relationship function:

---



---



---

Now let's implement the orders_per_day_and_holidays_2017 function:

hows this, im still getting different results than the test
